 <h3>How well do you really know the minions? Can you sing the Banana Song perfectly? Did you know they all have names? If you didn’t, you might want to educate yourself with these 8 facts.

 	1. These adorable little guys are all voiced by the same guy.
 	
 	2. The minions aren’t just speaking gibberish all the time. 
 	
 	3. Their language was actually created just for Despicable Me, combining Japanese, Spanish, Korean, and English words to make up the bizarre dialect. “Banana” is still the same, though!
 	
 	4. Pierre Coffin, the French animator responsible for directing both of the Despicable Me movies, as well as Minions, is the voice for all of the minions. 
 	
 	5. Minions only have three fingers.
 	
 	6. All of the minions’ names are male names.
 	
 	7. You can tell some of them apart and use their real names, too: Dave, Stuart, Kevin, Tim, Jerry, Mark, and Phil.
 	
 	8. According to voice actor and director Pierre Coffin, there are 899 Minions in all.</h3>
